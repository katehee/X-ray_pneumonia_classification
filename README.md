The main objective of this project is to detect pneumonia using chest X-ray images along with deep convolutional neural network.  Several biomedical image detection techniques have been proposed in the literature to help in diagnosing pneumonia. Some of these techniques use machine learning methods for feature extraction and classification and others use deep learning and transfer learning methods. The parameters of these methods are optimized to achieve high accuracy in disease classification. The authors in [1] used logistic regression as their supervised machine learning method and DenseNet as their deep learning model to diagnose Pneumonia. From a relatively low scale of The Area Under the Curve (AUC) of logistic regression model, the study conclude that logistic regression does not adequately capture the complexity of X-ray images. Whereas the proposed dense convolution network (DenseNet) with 121 layers achieves a better result. Deep learning is a better advancement over machine learning as it can easily operate on images and extract the features responsible to classify the disease.
